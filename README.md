# Progressive Vanilla (Rewind Classic)

This project is an independent continuation of the Vmangos core based on Elysium / LightsHope codebases. It is maintained by the Rewind WoW team. This may or may not sync upstream with Vmangos. 

### CI/CD 

This branch is monitored by a remote script. Pushes to the development branch are automatically pulled into new builds for the Rewind experimental realm. 

### Deployment 

Use the fork of vmangos-deploy (rewind-deploy) maintained by the Rewind team: 

https://github.com/rewind-wow/rewind-deploy

It includes many scripts to manage a wow instance (or many) in a production environment. Docker is recommended. Please see the readme in the repository for more information on environment variables required to run the scripts.
